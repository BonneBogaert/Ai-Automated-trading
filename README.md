The Replit scheduler will:
- Run trading sessions every hour during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:30 PM ET)
- Limit to 8 sessions per day to minimize API costs
- Send daily summaries at midnight
- Send market open notifications
- Generate detailed PDF reports with charts

### Manual Trading

You can also run specific functions:

```python
from ai_trader import AITrader

# Initialize the trader
trader = AITrader()

# Run analysis and trading
trader.analyze_and_trade(max_trades=3, min_confidence=7)

# Generate weekly report
trader.generate_weekly_report()
```

## Customization üéõÔ∏è

### Adding New Stocks

    'tech': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', ...],
    'renewable_energy': ['ENPH', 'SEDG', ...],
    'your_sector': ['STOCK1', 'STOCK2', ...]
}
```

### Modifying Trading Parameters

Edit `TRADING_CONFIG` in `config.py`:

```python
TRADING_CONFIG = {
    'max_trades_per_session': 5,      # More/fewer trades
    'min_confidence_score': 7,        # Higher/lower confidence threshold
    'position_size_pct': 0.02,        # Position size as % of portfolio
    # ... other parameters
}
```

### Custom Ethical Filters

Modify the `EthicalFilter` class in `ai_trader.py`:

```python
UNETHICAL_KEYWORDS = [
    'military', 'defense', 'weapons',
    # Add your own keywords
]
```

### Adjusting Schedule

For Replit deployment, modify `replit_scheduler.py`:

```python
self.max_sessions_per_day = 8  # Change number of sessions per day
```

## Risk Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This is for educational and research purposes only. Trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. Past performance does not guarantee future results.**

- Start with paper trading
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose
- Monitor the system regularly
- Understand that AI can make mistakes
- Consider consulting with a financial advisor

## Performance Monitoring üìä

The system provides several ways to monitor performance:

1. **Telegram Notifications**: Real-time trade alerts and summaries
2. **PDF Reports**: Detailed analysis with charts
3. **Log Files**: Detailed logs in `ai_trader.log` and `replit_scheduler.log`
4. **Alpaca Dashboard**: View your paper trading account
5. **Console Output**: Real-time status updates

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

1. **API Rate Limits**: The system handles rate limits automatically, but you may need to adjust timing
2. **Market Hours**: Paper trading is available 24/7, but real market data has limitations
3. **Network Issues**: The system will retry failed requests automatically
4. **Replit Timeout**: Use "Always On" repls to prevent timeouts

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in the scripts:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Test Your Setup

Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_system.py
```
